# AI Model Testing with GitHub Token

This repository is for demo purposes. You can use your GitHub Token to test AI models (OpenAI/GitHub Models) with these scripts and notebooks.

## How to Use

1. **Get a GitHub Token:**
   - Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) from [GitHub Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
   - Set the token in a `.env` file or as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai ipywidgets python-dotenv pillow
   ```

3. **Check the code:**
   - Each file (Python script or notebook) is a separate demo. Check the file name and run or review the code as needed.
   - Example: `imagechat.py` generates images from text, `chatbot-gpt4o.ipynb` is a chatbot demo, etc.

4. **Model/Deployment Name:**
   - Some scripts may have the model or deployment name hardcoded. Update it according to your Azure or GitHub Models setup.

## Note
- This repo is for demo/testing only. For production, keep your credentials and deployment details secure.
- Each code file contains comments or instructions. Please follow them.

**There are different code examples in this repo for demo purposes. Check the code files for details.**
